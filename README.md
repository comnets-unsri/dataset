- The Development of an Internet of Things (IoT) Network Traffic Dataset with Simulated Attack Data.

Abstract— This research focuses on the requirements for and the creation of an intrusion detection system (IDS) dataset for an Internet of Things (IoT) network domain. 
A minimal requirements Internet of Things (IoT) network system was built to produce a dataset according to IDS testing needs for IoT security. Testing was performed with 12 scenarios and resulted in 24 datasets which consisted of normal, attack and combined normal-attack traffic data. 
Testing focused on three denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks—“finish” (FIN) flood, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flood, and Zbassocflood/association flood—using two communication protocols, IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) and IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee). A preprocessing test result obtained 95 attributes for the WiFi datasets and 64 attributes for the Xbee datasets

- TCP FIN Flood Attack Pattern Recognition on Internet of Things with Rule Based Signature Analysis

Abstract-Focus of this research is TCP FIN flood attack pattern recognition in Internet of Things (IoT) network using rule based signature analysis method. Dataset is taken based on three scenario normal, attack and normal-attack. The process of identification and recognition of TCP FIN flood attack pattern is done based on observation and analysis of packet attribute from raw data (pcap) using a feature extraction and feature selection method. 
Further testing was conducted using snort as an IDS. The results of the confusion matrix detection rate evaluation against the snort as IDS show the average percentage of the precision level.
